    <p>Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant is most notorious for its rich history, celebrity origins and a teeming African-American population.
 </p>



<p>But in the past decade, that population of black residents has decreased sharply– especially in certain portions of the neighborhood.

<p>Data mapped by the New York City Department of Planning’s Population FactFinder tool precises the demographic changes by census tracts from 2010 and 2020. Looking at census tracts in the western and eastern populations of the neighborhood, the tracts in the western portion of the neighborhood have a significantly higher white population, especially in 2020. There are over 40 census tracts wholly within Community Board 3, which makes up a large area of Bed-Stuy.

<p> To condense the tracts, they were grouped into four classes for both the west and east. Taking census tracts and grouping them this way, it’s clear that the change is more prevalent in the west. New York City real estate broker of Push Forward Realty, Josh Brown, weighs in on why more white folks could be living in the western portion.

   <p><iframe title="[Demographic changes in parts of western and eastern Bedford-Stuyvesant, 2010-2020]" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-VQc0I" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/VQc0I/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="464" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

<p>“Generally when you go closer to Clinton Hill and Fort Greene, given that that's a shorter train ride to the city, you have a lot more white folks moving in and you're closer to the local amenities that are more prevalent on that side, opposed to the side closer to Brownsville,” said Brown.</p>
